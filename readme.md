# Group Project Proposal

**Water: Flooding and Stormwater**

[Popsal link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MboNS1FsnjUM-p-U7EeNH2uqcutj2vjf6wB25nufseU/edit)

**Introduction**

Winter storms in California can be unpredictable and on heavy storm years can result in flash floods, high coastal surf, and general flooding that creates treacherous conditions for people and animals. Current infrastructure and its condition in certain communities is poor and is unable to sufficiently protect communities from floods. We want to analyze whether flooding disproportionately impacts low income communities in San Diego.
This data is important because climate change will exacerbate weather conditions and those that will be most affected will be minority groups vulnerable to displacement. Infrastructure improvement is determined by studying what areas experience frequent flooding, ultimately making these communities safer to live in. Additionally, cities that are able to adapt to climate change are better able to protect those that reside there. With greater flood protection, residents are kept safe from personal injuries and property damage.

**Spatial Scope**

The spatial scope of this project will be at the city level with San Diego as our area of study. Specifically, we will look at areas that are prone to flooding such as Logan Heights and Mission Valley. These areas are also located close to bodies of water that rise during the rainy seasons and may overflow into unprotected communities.
Description of Data Sources
A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use Include datasource with links
Source 1: SanGIS Dataset 1: Drain SanGIS
Using this source, I will be able to access information on municipal storm sewer system, flood control, and road culverts in San Diego, San Diego County, and Unincorporated San Diego County. The information is available for download with a user account as a pdf or shapefile. Specifically, we would like to look at San Diego city data that looks at drain conveyance and prevalence in certain areas.
Source 2:Census
Using Census data would be useful for analysis of the area and the types of resources that are available in Logan Heights and Mission Valley (our primary location of analysis). This data can be downloaded and modified to what we need and want to be part of data visualization. We can use csv or zip.
Scope
A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project. For this project, we intend to analyze the impacts of flooding in low income communities in San Diego. We want to create a visualization of areas that experience heavy floods to see if movement of water motivates the movement of people as well. Do people relocate or stay in these areas? Does choosing to stay actually cost people more in the term if repairs are constantly needed? We want to analyze flooding and articulate its impact on people of different socioeconomic status via mapping to emphasize the importance of having flood protection in place for at risk areas.
Conclusion
A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research This research will provide visualization of what can be improved in these areas and where funding could be placed to prevent community members from being displaced because of natural disasters. Climate change is the main environmental issue in the world today. It impacts everything in environment making conditions unpredictable. It is important to prioritize the areas that are most vulnerable.




**Roles:**

Kelly → Flood Data Analysis 
Steph → Census Data Analysis (Clean Up and deeper analysis)
We both want to understand what we are analyzing and coding so we will be working together these are just the areas we assigned to one another.

**Status Update:**

Excited to see our final analysis of our data but we are a little worried about not having enough data or having too much data
Currently all is working I think its been a little hard to find times to meet and code together since I commute from the eastside.
Data Update:
Currently, we have 2 big datasets we need more help attempting to visualize in our own analysis
Flood Plain Data
Drain Conveyance data
We were able to convert the file and drop it onto jupyterhub

**Concerns:**

Data sources
What Census data can we use to better analyze potential flood risks?
How can we tie in Stormwater management? Sea Level rise analysis?
Is stormwater a solution?
How do we find a viable datasource? How do we clean it up without messing with the data?
https://mapshaper.org/ → data converter
How do we google a coding question?
“How do I find the mean of one row on python?”
