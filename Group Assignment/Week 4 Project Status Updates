## Mini Group Assignment
*** Roles ***
** Kelly → Flood Data Analysis ** 
** Steph → Census Data Analysis (Clean Up and deeper analysis) **
###### We both want to understand what we are analyzing and coding so we will be working together these are just the areas we assigned to one another.
*** Status Update: ***
** Excited to see our final analysis of our data but we are a little worried about not having enough data or having too much data. Currently all is working I think its been a little hard to find times to meet and code together since I commute from the eastside. **

*** Data Update: ***
###### Currently, we have 2 big datasets we need more help attempting to visualize in our own analysis
