**Introduction**

Winter storms in California can be unpredicatable and on heavy storm years can result in flash floods, high coastal surf, and general flooding that creates treacherous conditions for people and animals. Current infrastructure and its condition in certain communities is poor and is unable to sufficiently protect communities from floods. We want to analyze whether flooding disproportionately impacts low income communities in San Diego.

This data is important because climate change will exacerbate weather conditions and those that will be most affected will be minority groups vulnerable to displacement. Infrastructure improvement is determined by studying what areas experience frequent flooding, ultimately making these communities safer to live in. Additionally, cities that are able to adapt to climate change are better able to protect those that reside there. With greater flood protection, residents are kept safe from personal injuries and property damage.

**Spatial Scope**

The spatial scope of this project will be at the city level with San Diego as our area of study. Specifically, we will look at areas that are prone to flooding such as Logan Heights and Mission Valley.
These areas are also located close to bodies of water that rise during the rainy seasons and may overflow into unprotected communities.

**Description of Data Sources**

A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use
Include datasource with links

Source 1: [SanGIS](https://www.sangis.org/)

Using this source, I will be able to access information on municipal storm sewer system, flood control, and road culverts in San Diego, San Diego County, and Unincorporated San Diego County. The information is available for download with a user account as a pdf or shapefile.

**Scope**

A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project
For this project, we intend to analyze the impacts of flooding in low income communities in San Diego. We want to create a visualization of areas that experience heavy floods to see if movement of water motivates the movement of people as well. Do people relocate or stay in these areas? Does choosing to stay actually cost people more in the term if repairs are constantly needed? We want to analyze flooding and articulate its impact on people of different socioeconomic status via mapping to emphasize the importance of having flood protection in place for at risk areas.
