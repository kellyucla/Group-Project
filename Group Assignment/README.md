## Updated Group Midterm Proposal
**Kelly Banh and Stephanie Andrade**

**Introduction**

On average California gets about 21 inches of rain annually (cite). This rain fall is unpredictable and these heavy storm years often result in general flooding that creates  treacherous conditions for people and animals. In 1976 San Diego was hit by an unpredictable Category 1 hurricane, Hurricane Kathleen. This brought a record amount of destruction including damage to various transportation routes, freeways, homes, and railways (cite). This hurricane made vulnerable infrastructure come to light.

Since California rain fall is so sporadic, much of its current flood infrastructure in certain communities is poor and is unable to sufficiently protect communities from floods. This leaves many of these communities in danger of falling trees, stormwater pollution, damage to coastal structures caused by high coastal surf, and a number of additional health risks (cite).  Moreso, these rain fall events create dangerous debris flow in previous wildfire areas causing dangerous conditions for those who have been already been impacted by wildfires (cite). We want to analyze the disproportionate impacts of flooding in low income communities in San Diego. Our goal is to produce visual analysis showing vulnerable locations in the county in an effort to urge city officials to prioritize the safety of these communities.
 
Flood data is vital because it helps pinpoint the communities that are most vulnerable to displacement. Typically, these include minority groups living closer to flood prone areas with little flood protection. Flood data allows for an in depth analysis of where infrastructure can be improved by determining what areas experience frequent flooding. This is beneficial for cities because it allows them to adapt to climate change allowing them to better protect those that reside there. In a recent article by The San Diego Union Tribune San Diego flood insurance costs are on the rise. These costs come from FEMA new Risk Rating 2.0 implementation making insurance costs more equitable. Unfortunately, raising insurance costs does not necessarily reduce flood risks (cite). Flood protection is vital since climate change will continue to exacerbate weather conditions and create unpredictable rain fall events. It is important for residents safety; reducing injuries and devasting property damage.

**Spatial Scope**

The spatial scope of this project will be at the city level with San Diego as our area of study. Specifically, we will look at areas that are prone to flooding such as Logan Heights and Mission Valley.
These areas are also located close to bodies of water that rise during the rainy seasons and may overflow into unprotected communities.

**Description of Data Sources**

A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use
Include datasource with links

Source 1: [SanGIS](https://www.sangis.org/)
Dataset 1: [Drain SanGIS](https://rdw.sandag.org/Account/gisdtview?dir=StormDrain)

Using this source, I will be able to access information on municipal storm sewer system, flood control, and road culverts in San Diego, San Diego County, and Unincorporated San Diego County. The information is available for download with a user account as a pdf or shapefile. Specifically, we would like to look at San Diego city data that looks at drain conveyance and prevelance in certain areas.

Source 2:[Census](https://www.census.gov/)

Using Census data would be useful for analysis of the area and the types of resources that are available in Logan Heights and Mission Valley (our primary location of analysis). This data can be dowloaded and modified to what we need and want to be part of data visualization. We can use csv or zip.


**Scope**

A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project.
For this project, we intend to analyze the impacts of flooding in low income communities in San Diego. We want to create a visualization of areas that experience heavy floods to see if movement of water motivates the movement of people as well. Do people relocate or stay in these areas? Does choosing to stay actually cost people more in the term if repairs are constantly needed? We want to analyze flooding and articulate its impact on people of different socioeconomic status via mapping to emphasize the importance of having flood protection in place for at risk areas. 

**Conclusion**


A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research
This research will provide visualization of what can be improved in these areas and where funding could be placed to prevent community members from being displaced because of natural disasters. Climate change is the main environmental issue in the world today. It impacts everything in environment making conditions unpredictable. It is important to prioritize the areas that are most vulnerable.
