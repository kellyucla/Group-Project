**Introduction**
Winter storms in California can result in flash floods, high coastal surf, and general flooding that create treacherous conditions for people and animals. Depending on the existing infrastructure and its condition, some areas are unable to sufficiently protect communities from floods. We want to how does flooding impact low income communities in San Diego?

This data is important because climate change will exacerbate weather conditions and those that will be most affected will be minority groups. By studying what areas experiecnce frequent flooding, we can improve communities so that it is safer for people to live. Additionally, cities that are able to adapt to climate change are better able to protect those that reside there. With greater flood protection, residents are kept safe from personal injuries and property damage.

**Spatial Scope**
Our area of study will be in San Diego. Specifically, areas that are prone to flooding such as Logan Heights and Mission Valley.
These areas are also located close to bodies of water that rise during the rainy seasons and may overflow into unprotected communities.
