**Introduction**

On average California gets about 21 inches of rain annually [(Los Angeles Almanac)](http://www.laalmanac.com/weather/we13.php). This rain fall is unpredictable and these heavy storm years often result in general flooding that creates  treacherous conditions for people and animals. In 1976 San Diego was hit by an unpredictable Category 1 hurricane, Hurricane Kathleen. This brought a record amount of destruction including damage to various transportation routes, freeways, homes, and railways [(Academic)](https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1868797). This hurricane made vulnerable infrastructure come to light.
